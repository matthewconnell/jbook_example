## Conclusion

The Vancouver trees dataset contains lots of interesting info about the tree population in Vancouver. It is unfortunate that there is so much missing data, as it makes it difficult to draw valuable insights. From the charts made from the sample dataset, we can say that the majority of trees in Vancouver are of the genus Acer, and most of the trees were planted in the late 1990s.
